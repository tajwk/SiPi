# PATCH PLAN: Calibration Points API and SkyView Overlay

--- BACKEND (SiPi.py) ---
1. Add route /cal_points to return calibration points from PointErr.txt as JSON.
2. Add routes /enable_cal_point and /disable_cal_point to enable/disable a point (send EnablePoint N or DisablePoint N).

--- FRONTEND (skyview.js + index.html) ---
1. Add JS to fetch /cal_points and plot on SkyView overlay.
2. Add checkbox in Objects menu to toggle cal point visibility.
3. Make cal points clickable: show popup with RMS and enable/disable button.

--- DATA FORMAT ---
Each cal point: { index, ra, dec, error, enabled }

--- FILES TO EDIT ---
- SiPi.py (Flask API)
- static/js/skyview.js (plotting, interaction)
- templates/index.html (Objects menu checkbox)
